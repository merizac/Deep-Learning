In the context of online forums, although two questions may seem very different in terms of vocabulary, length and syntax, they may eventually ask the same thing. In this work,we try to detect semantically equivalent questions using a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The proposed CNN generates distributed vector representations for pairs of questions and score them using a similarity metric.
